/**
 1. Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations.
 + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus)
 Example: int sum = 10 + 5;

 2.  Relational (Comparison) Operators: Compare two values and return true or false.
 == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)
 Example: if (a > b)

 3.  Logical Operators: Combine multiple boolean expressions.
 && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
 Example: if (a > b && b > c)

 4.  Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables.
 = (assign), += (add and assign), -= (subtract and assign), etc.
 Example: x += 5; is the same as x = x + 5;

 5.   Unary Operators: Work with a single operand.
 + (positive), - (negative), ++ (increment), -- (decrement)
 Example: x++;

 6.     Bitwise Operators: Work with binary data.
 & (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), ~ (complement), << (left shift), >> (right shift)

 7. Ternary Operator: A shorthand for if-else.
 Syntax: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
 Example: int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

 8. Instanceof Operator: Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class.
 Example: if (obj instanceof String)
