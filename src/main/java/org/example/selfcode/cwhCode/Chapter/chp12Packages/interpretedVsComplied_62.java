 The interpreter translates one statement at a time into machine code. On the other hand,
 the compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code

/** one statement at a time An interpreter is needed every time Partial execution if an error occurs in the program.
        Easy for programmers.

 //TODO Compiler :
/** Entire program at a time Once compiled, it is not needed No execution if an error occurs
    Usually not as easy as interpreted once
