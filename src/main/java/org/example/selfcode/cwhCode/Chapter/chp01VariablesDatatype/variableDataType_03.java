     * A variable is a container that stores a value. This value can be changed during the execution of the program.
     * Example: int number = 8; (Here, int is a data type, the number is the variable name, and 8 is the value it contains/stores).
     * //TODO Rules for declaring a variable name:
     * Must not begin with a digit. (E.g., 1arry is an invalid variable)
     * Name is case sensitive. (Harry and harry are different)
     * Should not be a keyword (like Void).
     * White space is not allowed. (int Code With Harry is invalid)
     * Can contain alphabets, $character, _character, and digits if the other conditions are met.

// TODO Data Types
    /**
     in Java defines the kind of value a variable can store, like numbers, text, or true/false, and how much memory it needs.

     //TODO Types of Data Types in Java
     Java has two main types of data types:

     // TODO 1. Primitive Data Types
     These are the basic, predefined types of data that store simple values.

     Type	Definition	Example
     int	Stores whole numbers.	int age = 25;
     float	Stores decimal numbers (less precise).	float price = 10.5f;
     double	Stores decimal numbers (more precise).	double value = 99.99;
     char	Stores a single character.	char grade = 'A';
     boolean	Stores true or false.	boolean isActive = true;
     byte	Stores small whole numbers.	byte count = 100;
     short	Stores medium whole numbers.	short num = 5000;
     long	Stores large whole numbers.	long distance = 100000L;

     // TODO   2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
     These are more complex types used to store objects or collections of data.

     Type	Definition	Example
     String	Stores a sequence of characters (text).	String name = "John";
     Arrays	Stores a collection of similar data types.	int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
     Classes	User-defined types to group data and methods.	MyClass obj = new MyClass();
     Interfaces	Abstract types to define behavior.	interface MyInterface { ... }
