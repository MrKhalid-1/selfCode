/*
      Object-Oriented Programming tries to map code instructions with real-world,  making the code short and easier
      to understand.With the help of OOPs, we try to implement real-world entities such as object, inheritance,
      abstraction, etc. OOPs helps us to follow the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) approach of programming,
      which in turn increases the reusability of the code.

        Two most important aspects of OOPs - Classes & Objects :
        Class :
            A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
            Classes do not consume any space in the memory.
            Objects inherit methods and variables from the class.

        Objects :
            An object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template (info) is defined.
            Every object has some address, and it occupies some space in the memory.
            It is a physical entity.
            Take a look at the below example to get a better understanding of objects and classes :


        How to model a problem in OOPs
        We identify the following:

        Noun              - Class                        - Employee
        Adjective        - Attributes                  - name, age, salary
        Verb               - Methods                    - getSalary(), increment()
        This is all for this tutorial. We will do a detailed discussion on every aspect of OOPs in further tutorials.
